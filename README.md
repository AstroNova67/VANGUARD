Overview

Our goal is to leverage martian data from JMARS to build machine learning models that predict key surface and environmental attributes of Mars. These models aim to support the identification of ideal landing sites for future missions, based on scientific and engineering criteria.

By extracting and analyzing datasets such as **elevation**, **albedo**, **slope**, **thermal inertia**, and **surface roughness** from JMARS, we can train models that learn patterns associated with terrain suitability. These predictions can then guide the selection of potential landing zones that balance safety, scientific value, and accessibility.

## Objectives

- Collect and process Mars surface data  
- Engineer features that are relevant to mission planning  
- Train and evaluate models that predict surface attributes  
- Generalize predictions across diverse Martian terrain types  
- Identify and rank promising candidate sites for future exploration
